    <br><b>Docker</b> can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run
     in a <i>variety of locations,</i> such as on-premises, in public or private cloud.[9] When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel 
     (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS)[10] to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the 
     overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.[11] Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.[12]</br>

    <br><u>Because Docker containers are lightweight</u>, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously.[13] A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker 
    use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host.[14]</br>
    
    <br><font color="red">The Linux kernel's support</font> for namespaces mostly[15] isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted 
    file systems, <sup>while the kernel's cgroups</sup> provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.[16] Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called "libcontainer") 
    to use virtualization facilities provided directly by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.
